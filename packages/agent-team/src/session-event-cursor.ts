/**
 * Incremental Session-log fold with an identity guard.
 *
 * Several Host projections are pure left folds over one Member Session's own
 * events: context intent, the clock baseline, and the one-shot pressure
 * notice. Folding the whole log on every event makes each of them cost
 * O(session length) per step, so a long Session gets steadily slower. This
 * module keeps the fold value together with how far it has consumed the log,
 * so a step folds only the tail that arrived since — the same idiom the
 * Harness Session itself uses for its own derived folds.
 *
 * The module is deliberately Session-agnostic: it takes a plain event array
 * plus the log offset that array starts at, so a caller (including a
 * measurement harness) can drive it without constructing a Session.
 *
 * Correctness rests on the log being append-only, which it is: Session logs
 * have no truncation API, `seq` is the log index, and `seq === log.length` is
 * a documented contiguity contract. A Session adopts a different log only by
 * being constructed from another seed, which replaces the whole slice rather
 * than editing one position.
 *
 * The guard covers the observable ways that contract can break: a changed
 * `logFrom`, a shorter log, a different event type at the anchor. Each
 * re-folds from `logFrom`, so a fork, resume, or rollover degrades to the cost
 * of a cold fold and never to a wrong picture.
 *
 * Named residual: the guard anchors on `(seq, type)`, so an event replaced in
 * place by another of the SAME type at the SAME seq is not detected, and the
 * cursor would keep its old value and fold only the tail. Reaching that state
 * requires a caller to violate the append-only contract above — reading one
 * Session's cursor against a log someone rewrote in place. A content-sensitive
 * anchor would not close it either: only the anchor position is re-read, so a
 * swap at any earlier folded position passes a boundary digest just as
 * silently, while costing a payload digest on every advance. Closing it
 * properly means fingerprinting every folded event, which is the full refold
 * this module exists to avoid; if the contract ever changes, that is the fix.
