// tsdown reads the client's tsconfig `paths`, whose `/remote` entry points at
// the generated `.d.ts` for the type facets, and that mapping is what resolves
// this specifier; the generated runtime artifact is the one the package's own
// `./remote` export declares as `default`. The plugin therefore pins the
// specifier explicitly instead of leaving it to a mapping that targets types.
//
// The target is anchored to this config file, never to the process cwd. The
// earlier `resolve('../../../packages/...')` form was relative to whatever
// directory the config ran from — tsdown runs from `packages/client-agent-team`,
// one level deeper than the repository root the string was written for, so it
// silently pointed outside the repository.
